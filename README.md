|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `std::vector`              | `ArrayList`                      | Dynamic array that can resize itself.                                           |
| `std::list`                | `LinkedList`                     | Doubly-linked list.                                                             |
| `std::deque`               | `ArrayDeque`                     | Double-ended queue (deque) that supports insertion/removal at both ends.        |
| `std::stack`               | `Stack`                          | LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stack.                                                |
| `std::queue`               | `Queue` (interface)              | FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. Commonly implemented with `LinkedList`.        |
| `std::priority_queue`      | `PriorityQueue`                  | Priority queue (heap) where elements are ordered by priority.                   |
| `std::set`                 | `TreeSet`                        | Sorted set implemented as a balanced binary search tree (Red-Black Tree).      |
| `std::multiset`            | No direct equivalent             | Sorted multiset (allows duplicates). Can be emulated with `TreeMap<Integer, Integer>`. |
| `std::map`                 | `TreeMap`                        | Sorted map implemented as a balanced binary search tree (Red-Black Tree).      |
| `std::multimap`            | No direct equivalent             | Sorted multimap (allows duplicate keys). Can be emulated with `TreeMap<K, List<V>>`. |
| `std::unordered_set`       | `HashSet`                        | Hash table-based set.                                                          |
| `std::unordered_map`       | `HashMap`                        | Hash table-based map.                                                          |
| `std::unordered_multiset`  | No direct equivalent             | Hash table-based multiset (allows duplicates). Can be emulated with `HashMap<K, Integer>`. |
| `std::unordered_multimap`  | No direct equivalent             | Hash table-based multimap (allows duplicate keys). Can be emulated with `HashMap<K, List<V>>`. |
| `std::pair`                | `AbstractMap.SimpleEntry`        | A pair of two elements.                                                        |

### Notes:
1. **Java Collections Framework**: Java provides a rich set of data structures through its Collections Framework, which is similar to C++ STL but with some differences in implementation and naming.
2. **No Direct Equivalents**: Some C++ STL data structures (e.g., `multiset`, `multimap`) do not have direct equivalents in Java. However, they can be emulated using combinations of other data structures.
3. **Thread Safety**: Java provides thread-safe versions of some data structures (e.g., `Vector`, `Hashtable`, `ConcurrentHashMap`), whereas C++ STL data structures are not thread-safe by default.

### Example: Replacement for `std::vector` in Java
- **C++**: `std::vector<int> v;`
- **Java**: `ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();`
